#' The First of Two Overlapping Polygon Layers for Demonstration Purposes
#'
#' This polygon layer (\code{poly_1}) overlaps spatially with an other one
#' \code{\link{poly_2}}. They have one homonymous attribute \code{A} in common
#' and each of them is composed of four adjacent squares. These layers serve
#' the purpose of demonstrating the workings of the function \code{\link{st_or}}.
